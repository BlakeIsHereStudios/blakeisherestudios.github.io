            <h1>Creating A Personal Genealogy Site</h1>
            <p>So I got this idea a while ago to create my own personal genealogy site. I have experience with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, which I used to create this very site. However, I think that I will need to learn more JavaScript and PHP for this site.</p>
            <p>It won't be hosted on GitHub Pages because it has limits regarding stuff so it's probably not recommended for me to host it on there. I will most likely have to set up a home server to host it on (I have no experience in that by the way).</p>
            <p>So, what can you expect with this site? Well, the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Profiles of both my and famous people's ancestors and relatives, all connected into one giant family tree. My ancestors will be tagged as such.</li>
                <li>Tags for types of notables (i.e. US Presidents or Actors) and descendants from certain people (i.e. Mayflower Descendants and Descendants of Queen Victoria).</li>
                <li>Links on certain profiles to their profiles on other genealogy sites and their Wikipedia articles.</li>
                <li>See the famous relatives of someone (or just see the relationship between 2 random people in the tree) by going to a special page.</li>
                <li>See a person's coefficient of inbreeding (COI).</li>
                <li>Support for multiple languages.</li>
                <li>GEDCOMs can be imported and then the profiles can be merged into the main tree.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm doing it all myself because I enjoy the challenge of coding everything from scratch instead of using a template.</p>
